I love **web development** and want to do it for a job. It all started as a
hobby. Doing various _online courses_ and code _katas_ I eventually realised
that I would like to do it full time. So, I started looking at job openings and
see what gaps did I have in my knowledge.

Also, having more than 5 years of experience as a **QA Engineer** I have quite a
lot of experience with the _software development life cycle_, _agile_ practices
and working in a _team_. Thanks to my previous job, I deeply understand what
quality and _customer focus_ means.

I think I chose that job because I like _solving puzzles_, getting to the bottom
of the _bug_ and understanding its root cause. What I didn't know is that
programming puzzles are much more fun to solve. One the social side, I like
travelling and socks with funny patterns. :)
